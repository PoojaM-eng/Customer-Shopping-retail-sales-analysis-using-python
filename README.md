# Customer-Shopping-retail-sales-analysis-using-python

Excited to share my latest data analytics project, where I used cutting-edge techniques to extract insights and drive meaningful business decisions. From data cleaning to visualization, this project showcases my passion for leveraging data to drive value.
I have gathered data from various age groups and genders to provide a comprehensive view of shopping habits. The dataset includes essential information such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations.
